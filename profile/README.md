The TIDE project creates a computational core facility focused on meeting the research needs of faculty within the California State University (CSU) system by the National Science Foundation. The Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE) is designed to support cutting-edge research in machine learning and AI. The computing architecture is based on powerful graphics, high-performance processors, and ample storage to support research discovery.

The main objective of our collaborative team with project leadership at San Diego State University, CSU San Bernardino, Cal Poly Humboldt, CSU Stanislaus, and the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) is to boost data-intensive research in various scientific fields across our 23 CSU campuses.

This GitHub organization contains repositories with sample code, tutorials, as well as hosts our technical documentation.
